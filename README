Greetings Glider fans! Well, it is 2014, and I have ported my old Glider 
game from 1997 over to Android for you to play on your current devices! 
The game is basically the same as before, I wrote an ANSI terminal 
emulator for Android to run the game's original C code pretty much 
unmodified via the NDK. You can use the touch screen controls on a 
mobile or tablet to emulate the arrow keys, and touch in the center to 
select. On an Android Wear device, you can touch the display on the 
edges to emulate the arrow keys. The wearable also allows you to tilt 
the device to emulate the arrow keys. If you have a game controller or 
TV then the game supports those controls as well.

This is *really* old messy code that I wrote back when I was learning to 
program in C back in 1996. It was designed to run on text terminals over 
slow serial connections in my university Unix labs, which is why the 
graphics are the way they are! :)

Here are some links to the original game this is based on, written by 
John Calhoun back in 1990:

You can download the game directly to your Android device from the
