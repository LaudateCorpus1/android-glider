# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# By default, the flags in this file are appended to flags specified
# in /Applications/Android Studio.app/sdk/tools/proguard/proguard-android.txt
# You can edit the include path and order by changing the proguardFiles

# Add any project specific keep options here:

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}


# Do not strip any of my Java code out, need to keep it around for JNI calls to use
-keep class net.waynepiekarski.glider.** { *; }
